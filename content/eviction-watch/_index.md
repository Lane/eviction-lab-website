<h2 class="subhead bordered-header">Evictions During COVID-19</h2>

We are tracking evictions on a weekly basis to monitor the impacts of COVID-19. Below is a list of cities where we are able to access eviction data in real time.

Select one of the cities to see a detailed report on filings per week, how it compares to previous years, and which neighborhoods are filings disproportionately higher than normal.
